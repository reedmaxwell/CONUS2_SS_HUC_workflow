# Steady-State workflow for subsetting a HUC from the CONUS2 domain

This workflow contains Juypyter notebooks for using [SubsetTools](https://hydroframesubsettools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to subset a HUC from the [CONUS2](https://hydroframe.org/parflow-conus2) domain, modify a [ParFlow](https://parflow.org) runscript, then configure a special [EcoSLIM](https://github.com/reedmaxwell/EcoSLIM) run to trace out streamlines within that domain.
